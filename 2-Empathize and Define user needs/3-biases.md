# Biases

hard to completely get rid

## Confirmation bias

This bias occurs when you start looking for
evidence to prove a hypothesis you have.
Because you think you already have the answer,
you're drawn to information that confirms
your beliefs and preconceptions.

### how to overcome
- ask open ended questions
- actively listen, without adding opinion
- large number of users with diverse prespectives

## False consensus bias

Happens when we
overestimate the number of
people who will agree with our idea or design,
which creates a false consensus.

### how to overcome
- identify and articulate assumptions
- survey large number of users with diverse prespectives

## Recency bias and primacy bias

Recency bias, when it's easiest to remember the last thing you heard in an interview,
conversation, or similar setting, because it's the most recent.
When talking to someone, you're more likely to remember things they shared at
the end of the conversation.

primacy bias, you remember the first participant most strongly.
Sometimes the first person you
meet makes the strongest impression,
because you're in a new situation
or having a new experience.

### how to overcome

- take detailed notes or recordings for each interview or conversation you have.
- interview each participant in the same way, be consistent


## Implicit bias or unconscious bias

Implicit bias is a collection of attitudes and
stereotypes we associate to
people without our conscious knowledge.
One of the most common forms of
implicit bias in UX is when
we only interview people within
a limited set of identity profiles,
such as race, age,
gender, socioeconomic status, and ability.
These profiles are generally based on
assumptions we have about certain types of people.
For example, implicit bias
might cause you to feel uncomfortable
interviewing people whose life experiences
are different from your own.

On the other hand,
we might choose to interview people
from typically excluded groups,
but then ask potentially offensive questions
because of our internalized stereotypes.

lead to a lack of representation in our research and design process.

### how to overcome
we can reflect on our behaviors, and we can
ask others to point our implicit biases.
That's one of the best ways we can
become aware of our biases.


## sunk cost fallacy.

This is the idea that the deeper we get into a project we've invested in,
the harder it is to change course without feeling like we've failed or wasted time.

### how to overcome
- break down in smaller phases design
- outline points where to decide whether to continue or stop



l secondo è il bias del costo opportunità (opportunity cost bias). La scarsa percezione del fatto che qualsiasi scelta attuata (per esempio, andare in ufficio) implica sempre e in ogni caso anche un costo, corrispondente al valore (o al beneficio) che potrebbe essere conseguito compiendo una scelta alternativa (per esempio, fare una passeggiata).



## How to avoid bias
ask for motivations desires needs of people
why we have chosen a particolar person to interview, who we are excluding

 Choose your words carefully.
 Choosing leading words can cause the framing effect, where users make a decision or choice based on the way information was presented to them.
 This is especially critical in usability studies. For example, imagine a participant is testing your designs. You ask the participant: “Do you like or dislike the improved layout of these buttons?” --->“Explain how you feel about the layout of the buttons.”


 Foster independent thinking. Group interviews can be affected by the bandwagon effect, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn’t align with the majority of the group.

 Avoid specific language. It’s important to be mindful about the types of questions you ask users and how those questions are framed. You’ll need to be careful to avoid confirmation bias, which is trying to find evidence to prove a hypothesis you already have.

 Limit the guidance you give users. Everyone learns and thinks in different ways. When you’re conducting any type of UX research, you have to be cautious to avoid experiencing any false consensus, which is the assumption that others will think the same way as you do.
 It’s important to let participants follow their own paths through your product, without interrupting them.


  “Is any of this making you uncomfortable?”,

  Be careful of your own body language and reactions. You also have to be mindful of your own tone and body language while interacting with participants. Social desirability bias can happen when a participant answers a question based on what they think you want to hear. If you ask a question to a participant, and they notice you exhibiting a visual or audible clue that suggests your own opinion about the question, they might answer in a way that they think will please you.
