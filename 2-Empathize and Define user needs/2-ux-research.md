# User experience research

* how user experience research fits into the development of a product
* common types of UX research methods and their benefits and drawback
* biases in UX research.

UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations
through observation and feedback.
prioritise the user

the gap between what business think the user need and actually needs

## Foundational research (strategic or generative research)

Before anything is designed inspire new design directions.
During this stage, you make personas and user stories
find user needs and how to address those needs with your product.

Questions you might ask during this research phase are:
* What should we build?
* What are the user’s problems?
* How can we solve those problems?
* Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?

The goal of foundational research is to help define the problem you would like to design a solution for.
Foundational research reveals opportunities and identify pain points

research methods include:

Interviews:
Collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings.

Surveys:
An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.

Focus groups:
A small group of people whose reactions are studied.
For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design.
A focus group is usually run by a moderator who guides the group on a certain topic of conversation.

Competitive audit:
An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses.

Field studies: Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab.

Diary studies: A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time.
Often, a user will log, or diary, about their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs.

## Design research (tactical research)

Research that takes place during the design phase, phase 3, of the product development life cycle
Questions to answer:
* how should we build it
  * How was your experience using the prototype today?
  * How easy or difficult was it to use? Why?
  * Did you encounter any challenges?

Paper or prototype based on research goal

## Post-launch research

answers the question, "Did we succeed?"
happens at the end of the product development life cycle
You might also want to check your product's performance against the competition.

## UX research

UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs,
and motivations through observation and feedback.
Your product design should be built upon research and facts, not assumptions.

## research methods

### Who conducts
+ Primary: you conduct yourself
+ Secondary: someone else, article, journals, statistics

### Type of data
+ Qualitative why and how did this happen
+ Quantitative Surveys , misure how many how much

Interviews
in depth ask about experience, not only vote 1-10 but a complex open ended response
performed one-on-one or in a group setting, like a focus group.

Surveys
better after pain point clear
mix Quantitative and qualitative Questions

Usability studies
evaluate a product testing it on users
find pain point end user
 after iyou can interviuv them

 kpis

 the research method we choose is decided by
the question we are trying to answer
