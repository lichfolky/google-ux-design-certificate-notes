Design sprints

to answer questions, define product directions, figure out cross-team strategies, and even build team culture.

five phases typically spread out over five full, eight-hour days.
The ideal team size in a design sprint is around 4â€“7 people

Design sprints generally include five phases:

- understand
- ideate (sketch)
- decide
- prototype
- test (validate)

Before launching into a design sprint, you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these key questions:

Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge?

Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in?

Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint?

If you answered yes to any one of these questions, a design sprint might be the right move.

understand the scope of the design challenge, ideate possible solutions, decide on the most viable solution,
create a workable prototype, and finally, test that prototype with actual users.

## Why a Sprint:

popular

- all about the user and their needs
- value every person in the room and diffrent skills
- the best ideas rise to the top
- time to focus solely on a design challenge.

that's a recipe for some serious problem-solving. Also, sprints lower the risk of an unsuccessful market debut. Because the team gets feedback from real users and can make critical adjustments before the product launches.
