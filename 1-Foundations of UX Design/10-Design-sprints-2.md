### Plan a design sprint

- user research
  -> focus or question -> research method
- call the experts
  talks with expert
  plan early
  to clarify the problem
- find the right space
  whitebords sticky notes
  confortable
  accomodations
- gather supplies
  snacks, water, pens, paper
- establish sprint rules
- plan introduction
  ice braker, motivate, right mindset es:
  - fake a call to customer care. -> in the shoes of the customer
  - sketch of their superhero version.
- post sprint planning
  documentation, choose peopple to create it

### The design sprint brief

The sprint brief is a document that you'll share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint.

The design sprint challenge:

- Start with the design sprint challenge
- identify the key deliverables
- Logistics:
  - When
  - Where
  - Who
- Approvers
- Resources
  ???
- project
  Wrap it all up with a sprint schedule, an hour-by-hour schedule of the five-day sprint, including break times.

## Example

https://medium.com/inkoniq-blog/inside-a-design-sprint-workshop-at-google-3950b1654f2

- understand
  - lightning talks
  - reviewing use cases
  - discussing different user research findings
  - competitor benchmarking
- ideate (sketch)
  - HMW exercise (How Might We)
  - user interviews,
  - customer journey mapping
  - unearth the user personas, their needs, and motivations
  - affinity map by grouping them into different categories
  - Each team member then voted for their top three favorites using the dot method to trim down the opportunities.
  - Crazy 8’s. Finally, each individual had to sketch 8 potential UI solutions
- decide
- prototype
- test (validate)

Getting started is more important than being right
Assumptions are okay, hypothesis, gut feelings and thus not user research.
The beauty of the sprint is that it encourages us to take risks and gives us the tools to deal with them.

HMW
gives you the perfect frame for innovative thinking.

- Start by looking at the insight statements that you’ve created. Try rephrasing them as questions by adding “How might we” at the beginning.
- The goal is to find opportunities for design, so if your insights suggest several How Might We questions that’s great.
- Now take a look at your How Might We question and ask yourself if it allows for a variety of solutions. If it doesn’t, broaden it. Your How Might We should generate a number of possible answers and will become a launchpad for your Brainstorms.
- Finally, make sure that your How Might We’s aren’t too broad. It’s a tricky process but a good How Might We should give you both a narrow enough frame to let you know where to start your Brainstorm, but also enough breadth to give you room to explore wild ideas.

## Design sprint retrospectives

no multiple time same mistake
collaborative critique of the team's design sprint.
The two key questions we aim to answer in the meeting are: "What went well?" and "What can be improved?

They can help you to work better as a team, improve how you communicate with clients, and even point out areas where you can grow as an individual.
no shaming

During a design sprint, the focus is on:
Understanding the design challenge
Ideating solutions
Deciding which solutions to build
Prototyping a few solutions
Testing those prototypes

- What went well?
  Which tools saved you the most time and effort?
  When did you feel the most satisfaction?
  What helped you make your best contribution to the team during this sprint?
  --> celebrate success

- What can be improved
  Encourage everyone to participate in sharing areas for improvement. You might even take turns going around a circle and adding challenges to a shared list. If anyone is nervous about speaking up, invite each person to write their thoughts anonymously on individual sticky notes. Then, all of the improvements can be reviewed together. This eliminates concerns about causing offense and reduces the chance of groupthink. Groupthink can occur in a group discussion when one person shares an opinion and everyone immediately agrees with the opinion, instead of sharing their own feelings about a topic. Groupthink prevents each person from having an equal say, and it might mean certain areas for improvement are overlooked.

What went wrong that caught you off guard?
Which problems came up the most often?
When do you think we experienced the biggest challenge as a team?

Did the team overestimate or underestimate the work required to complete the design?
Did an external factor derail your productivity?
And most importantly, does the final design actually solve the user problem?
Identify ways that the team could have ended up with a better solution.

Keep in mind, retrospectives are about empowering, not shaming. This is not the time to call out an individual for poor performance. If you have issues with a team member’s work, it’s best to address it with that person privately, not during a team-wide retrospective.
