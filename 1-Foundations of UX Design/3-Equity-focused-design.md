### Universal design

**_One-size-fits-all solution_**

is the process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations. Think of it like a one-size-fits-all approach.

Designers propose one solution for everyone.

The problem is that when you focus on creating one solution for everyone, the designs lose their effectiveness. It's often difficult to achieve any goals with your product when you have so many intended users.

### Inclusive design

**_Solve for one, extend to many._**

inclusive design means making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, age, and gender

normal doesn't exist.

**Accessibility**: Designing products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.

### Equity-focused design

**_for underrepresented groups_**

Equity-focused design takes the idea of inclusive design one step further.

Focus on designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products.
The goal of equity-focused design is to uplift groups that have been excluded historically.

Equality != Equity
Equality means providing the same amount of opportunity and support to all segments of society.
Equity means providing different levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes.

Start by identifying a product you want to build.
Then, think about the groups that have not been served by this type of product in the past.
Finally, build your design while keeping the groups who identified as underrepresented front and center.

Equity-focused design doesn't solve all problems, just like inclusive design and universal design don't either.
The key point is that these are all different approaches to solving issues of underrepresentation and designing for a more equitable future.

### Equity-focused design (generally race and gender, but this extends beyond just race and gender to things like: ability, age, and socioeconomic status)

Equity-focused design means thinking through all the aspects of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities. Plus, the designs need to specifically consider underrepresented and excluded groups.

Gender neutral pronouns on these kinds of forms

When designing these forms, you should also consider whether a certain question even needs to be included in the first place. Ask yourself why you're collecting this information and whether or not you really need it.

Gender nonconforming means having a gender identity that doesn't conform to a society's gender norms.

And nonbinary means having a gender identity that's neither entirely male or entirely female.

As cisgender white male sometimes i feel equitable design choices as a loss in my privileges (also if I know it is fair). So I don't think my personal experience should be the only way to evaluate the experience of a product. It's not generally true that equitable design leave the usual focus user with the same experience, or a better one. So we should be honest and pretend equity, not try to justify it. Because equity is a higher lever of experience, not only a product level one.

## Global Accessibility

Nithya Sambasivan and Astrid Weber

As UX researchers, we often find similar—sometimes even identical—issues that impact users’ ability to interact with their tech; and while the restrictions across users and use cases vary, the design implications are similar. For example, bright sunshine, low vision, or a cracked phone screen can all be factors that motivate the need for better contrast ratios.

opportunity to proactively build ethical and meaningful products that are inclusive of societies and cultures worldwide

It’s also important to understand that accessibility is almost always intersectional; norms of gender, religion, or class may further include or exclude people from technology.

Learn about local design and embrace the aesthetics you find in your app’s visual language and imagery.

Accommodate different levels of literacy and many different languages

Use simple, basic English and avoid jargon.

Translate to languages your users are most comfortable with for reading. Test various languages and text flows in your app’s interface. For example, Arabic takes more vertical space and is rendered right to left.

Keep your sentences short and provide graphical cues to guide non-literate users and people with cognitive disabilities. Combining text with images--such as a written menu with clear icons--enables easier and faster access across all literacy levels.

Avoid complex hierarchical structures, such as menus, tabs, or drop downs, as users are more likely to get lost; plus, those who access your app with a screen reader might need a long time to find what they are looking for.

Minimize the need to type or text search. Whenever possible, allow voice input, autocomplete text fields, and present browseable interfaces.
