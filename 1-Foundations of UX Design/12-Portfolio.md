How does the portfolio establish the designer’s personal brand? (What type of first impression do each of these three designers make?) As a designer, your personal brand is how your personality, unique skills, and values intersect with your public persona. Your brand is the first impression you make! A personal brand should clearly demonstrate who you are as a designer and what makes you interesting.
Is the navigation simple and intuitive? The navigation is the way users get from page to page on a website. Users should be able to reach the homepage from any part of your site. And your navigation should lead them from one project to the next. It should also be easy for users to navigate to a contact page that includes an email address, a copy of a resume, and links to other professional social media accounts.
Does the portfolio website go beyond the template? Although a website builder’s pre-designed layouts make it easy to get started, you need to go a step further. Portfolio designers can customize their websites to align with their brand and the story they want to tell. For example, designers should remove the text that comes pre-loaded in the template, and replace it with their own content. It's also helpful to register their own domain name, so their website’s address doesn’t contain the name of the website builder.
Does the portfolio website include a diversity of projects? Each portfolio should have 3-6 projects that demonstrate the designer’s skills. Note whether each portfolio contains a diversity of projects.
Is the site housing the portfolio responsive? Responsive means the on-screen appearance of the website adjusts based on the user’s device. So whether someone engages with the website on a desktop computer or mobile phone, they will have a positive experience.

Showcase your process, not just the finished product. Write about the methods you used, what you learned along the way, the challenges you came up against, and how you solved certain problems. Each case study should tell a complete, logical story.

Unsolicited redesign à la Priyanka Gupta.
“Despite using the app religiously, I had trouble navigating through it. After observing that other people also experienced issues with the app, I pursued this redesign as an opportunity to improve the experience in any way I could.”
What follows is a detailed breakdown of every step she took to redesign the app, from brand analysis and user research, right through to persona creation, prototyping, and implementation—not forgetting those all-important visual artifacts that are absolutely crucial to UX storytelling!

For each case study in your UX portfolio, provide as much context as you can.

# Best practices

Pro-tip number 1: Establish your personal brand. Your personal brand is the way in which your personality, unique skills, and values as the designer intersect with your public persona. We'll learn more about branding later, but the main thing to know is that your personal brand is the first impression you make. Your personal brand should clearly demonstrate who you are and what makes you interesting.
Pro-tip number 2: Tell a story. Your website could easily turn into a list of links and photos, but to engage your audience, you need to tell a story about your design process with a beginning, middle, and end. This might mean that you start with an introduction of the design problem. Then in the middle, show the process you followed to complete the designs, like user research, sketches, and wireframes. Then end with an image of the polished design, and an endorsement from your client or another person whose opinion you value.
Pro-tip number 3: Be concise. Use minimal text to describe your work, and highlight the key insights that help inform your decisions. Let your work speak for itself. If you need to explain your work in more detail, add links to other pages or PDFs.
Pro-tip number 4: Keep your navigation simple and intuitive.
Pro-tip number 5: Go beyond the template. Although website builders' pre-designed layouts make it easy to get started, you need to go a step further. Customize your website to align with your brand and the story you want to tell. You should demonstrate your design skills and provide a good user experience. For example, remove the text that comes pre-loaded in the template and replace it with your own content. Also, register your own domain name so that your website's address doesn't contain the name of the website builder. You can buy a domain directly through website builders or through a third-party service.
Pro-tip number 6: Include a diversity of projects. You should have three to six projects in your portfolio that demonstrate the range of your skills. At the end of this program, you'll have created at least three projects, so you'll be well on your way. Make sure each project shows a different facet of your design talents.
Pro-tip number 7: Feature case studies. A case study leads the user through your design process, from the beginning to the end. Your portfolio should feature case studies, not just mockups of design ideas. A case study answers these questions: What was the problem you were trying to solve? What process did you follow? Where did you succeed or fail? What insights informed your design decisions along the way? What was the ultimate solution, and why do you feel that solution was the best? When describing case studies, you might want to include things like the project's name and duration, your role on the design team, including your personal contributions to the project, the project's goal, the research that was conducted, the intended audience, any sketches or wireframes, user testing results, the final design, and a conclusion about what you learned in the process. You'll learn more about each of these elements as you continue through the program. One more thing to keep in mind about case studies: Be careful not to share any proprietary information or break a nondisclosure agreement, if you have one. A nondisclosure agreement is a contract an employee might sign when working with a business, in which they agree not to share sensitive information, like designs in the process of being developed.
Pro-tip number 8: Make sure your website is responsive.
pro-tip number 9: Test your website
