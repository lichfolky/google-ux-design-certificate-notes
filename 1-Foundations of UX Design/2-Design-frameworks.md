Users: person that uses the product
End users: is the specific audience a UX designer creates something for.

Prototype: scaled down version of a product that shows important functions

Framework: creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you’re trying to solve, kind of like an outline for a project. It creates the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you're trying to solve.

**User centered design**
At the core of the user-centered design process is a deep empathy for the user. It’s not just about what a product does for a user, it’s about how the experience of interacting with the design makes the user feel.
It’s an iterative process.

- Understand
  Research how user experience the product or similar one, and the environment or context as well.
  This requires a lot of research, like observing users in action and conducting interviews
- Specify
  Narrow down the user needs and problems (what is the most important to solve?)
- Design
  Come up with solutions to the end user problem, then start design them
- Evaluate
  Evaluate your designs against your end user's needs. Test with real people, collect feedbacks.

Guiding principles:

- Design for users and their needs. It can be tempting to design something in a certain way because it looks cool or solves one of your own problems. You're designing to help a diverse set of humans with specific needs.
- Make your copy conversational. The writing within your product design should have a friendly, simple, and easily accessible tone. Avoid jargon or overly-complicated terminology that users might not understand.
- Present all information clearly. Users should be able to navigate your product design easily and without assistance from others. Make key information, like checkout buttons, simple to find and identify.
- Acknowledge user actions. Your product should let users know when they’ve executed a task correctly. That might be as simple as having a new window pop up when an icon is pressed, or as complex as animated tossed confetti to demonstrate that the user has accomplished a task.
- Offer support. As UX designers, our goal is to make designs accessible and understandable to every user, but sometimes we fall a bit short. Offer users a safety net, like a support center or list of Frequently Asked Questions. Make sure a frustrated user doesn’t have to swipe and click all over the product to find help.

**The five elements of UX design**

From an abstract idea to a concrete product

- Strategy
  Define the user's needs and business objectives.

  The reason for the product, application or the site, why we create it, who are we doing this for, why people are willing to use it, why they need it. The goal here is to define the user needs and business objectives.
  This could be done through Strategic Research Process, where you interview users, and all stakeholders in addition to review the competing products or companies.

- Scope
  this is where you'll determine what you're building, the features and content to be included in the product.

  Defines the functional and content requirements. What are the features, and content contained in the application or product. The requirements should fulfill and be aligned with the strategic goals.

  Functional Requirements: It’s the requirements about the functions, or features in the product, how features work with each other, and how they interrelate with each other. These features is what user need to reach the objectives.
  Content Requirements: It’s the information we need in order to provide the value. Information like text, images, audio, videos, …etc. Without defining the content, we have no idea about the size or time required to complete the project.

  The feature is having a media player for songs, while the content is the audio files for these songs.

- Structure
  how to organize your design and how the user will interact with it.

  how user interact with the product, how system behave when user interact, how it’s organized, prioritized, and how much of it. Structure is split into two components, Interaction Design & Information Architecture.
  Interaction Design: Given the functional requirements, It defines how user can interact with the product, and how the system behaves in response to the user interactions.
  Information Architecture: Given the content requirements, It defines the arrangement of content elements, how they are organized, to facilitate human understanding.

  Good Interaction design:
  helps people to accomplish their goals.
  effectively communicates interactivity and functionality(what user can do).
  informs user about state changes(file has been saved, or any feedback), while they interact.
  prevents user error or mistakes, like the system asks user to confirm potentially harmful action(i.e. deletion).
  Good Information Architecture:
  organizes, categorizes, and prioritizes the information based on user needs and business objectives.
  makes it easy to understand and move through information presented.
  flexible to accommodate growth and adapt to change.
  appropriate for the audience.

- Skeleton
  the layout.

  Wireframes are widely used to create a visual format, which is a Static diagrams that represent a visual format of the product, including content, navigation and ways for interactions.
  Skeleton is split into three components Interface Design, Navigation Design, & Information Design.
  Interface Design: presenting and arranging interface elements to enable users to interact with the functionality of the system.
  Navigation Design: how to navigate through the information using the interface.
  Information Design: defines the presentation of information in a way that facilitates understanding.

- Surface
  is how the product looks to the user, the interface that users view and interact with.

each layer is dependent on the one below it.

**The design thinking process**

Design thinking is a way to create solutions that address a real user's problem and are functional and affordable.

- Empathize
  discovering what end users really need and learning how to think and feel like them. Surveys, interviews, or observation session, who your end users are and the challenges they face.
- Define
  the problem by creating a clear problem statement. Description of the user's need that should be addressed, based on user research should be a clear goal.
- Ideate
  ideate or brainstorm solutions.
  The goal of ideation is to come up with as many design solutions as possible.
- Prototype
  narrow down to a few ideas that we can prototype.
  Creating prototypes helps your team get a feel for what the product will actually look like and how users will experience the product.
- Test
  test the prototype with users
  You can use this feedback to make changes and improvements to your designs, as many times as you need.

**Lean UX**

The Lean UX process focuses on reducing wasted time and resources, and producing a workable product as soon as possible.
Think.
Make. -> MVP which is a simple prototype of your designs that you can test with the target audience
Check.

Principles:

- Move forward. Focus only on design elements and features that move the design process toward a particular goal. Don’t get distracted by “nice-to-haves.”
- Stay curious. Lean UX is about using feedback from users and stakeholders to revise and improve your designs. Continuously seek feedback to understand why specific design choices work or don’t work.
- Test ideas in the real world. Lean UX encourages designers to test their ideas - using prototypes, for example - outside of the conference room and with potential users.
- Externalize your ideas. Instead of internally debating and analyzing whether or not an idea is going to work, turn your ideas into something physical, viewable, and testable, while they’re still fresh in your mind. This way, you’ll get feedback on your designs in the early stages, when diverse perspectives and feedback are most helpful.
- Reframe deliverables as outcomes. Focus on creating usable, enjoyable products that users actually want and need. Always keep in mind that you’re designing for your users first-and-foremost, not for the project stakeholders.
- Embrace radical transparency. Feel comfortable being honest with everyone on the team (and expect the same in return), since you will depend on each other’s insights. This way, everyone can make informed decisions about how to move forward and avoid wasting time and energy.

**Double Diamond**
Research:

- Discover the problem. Gather information about potential issues users are facing.
- Define the problem. Filter through the data, and focus on the main issue your product aims to solve.
  Design:
- Develop solutions for the problem. Begin designing your product as a work in progress. This is where wireframes and prototypes come into play.
- Deliver the product. Review and test your product to prepare it for release.

Principles:

- Focus on the user. As is always the case in UX design, the user is the top priority.
- Communicate. Communicate visually, through imagery and design choices that supplement the text. You should also be sure that the communication of your design is equitable and accessible, which you'll learn more about in this part of the program.
- Collaborate. One of the unique features of the Double Diamond process is that it encourages creative collaboration and co-creation with your fellow team members.
- Iterate. Accept that the design is a work in progress and isn’t going to be complete right away. The magic is in the revision. With every iteration, you give the user a new experience.
