**Social model of disability**
defines a disability as being caused by the way society is organized or how products are designed rather than a person's ability or difference.

As designers, we need to account for disabilities that are permanent, temporary, or situational in our designs.

Situational challenges often aren't considered legal disabilities, but we still need to solve them.

An example of a situational challenge is when you're driving on a dark road late at night, your vision is probably not as clear as it would be in the daylight, which is a situational challenge.
Another example is if you're visiting a country where you don't speak the language, your hearing is situationally limited.

No two users are exactly alike.
Physical and cognitive disabilities, as well as environmental factors, can inhibit people from fully engaging with technology: hardware, software, and beyond.

As UX researchers, we often find similar—sometimes even identical—issues that impact users’ ability to interact with their tech; and while the restrictions across users and use cases vary, the design implications are similar. For example, bright sunshine, low vision, or a cracked phone screen can all be factors that motivate the need for better contrast ratios.
