next billion users

- Cost
=> less performance, storage devices
- Connectivity
 their network coverage is inconsistent or sporadic => offline experiences
- Digital literacy
not familiar to call to action, icons, actions, eg swipe and touchscreen => keep it simple, videotutorial
- literacy, some user are not able to read and have a different language =>
Designing a multilingual keyboard option, and using universally understood icons, like an icon with a currency sign for a banking app


you notice only bad design, not good one

9 point:
- Internet access isn’t guaranteed
- Smaller, simpler devices are the norm
  Most emerging-market devices cost just $40-60 and might come with 512MB of memory, a small, low-res screen, and limited battery life.
  John, who works as a trader in Accra, is an example of a typical user you might want to keep in mind: He purchased his smartphone from a second-hand market, and he uses two SIM cards—one for professional contacts and another for friends and family, as a way to reduce inter-carrier calling costs.

- Data is limited
  In about 95 percent of emerging markets, people rely almost entirely on expensive prepaid mobile data, and many can only afford 250MB of data per month
  People will turn off their phones at night to save data and avoid accidental expenses.
  Shalini, a young woman we met in Mumbai, powers down her phone after each browsing session, especially at night.

  need to consider how to optimize the amount of data an app uses—from installation, usage, and updates, to uninstallation and background services.

- Forget about credit cards
  Some 38 percent of the world’s population doesn’t use a bank, and less than 2 percent of Indians have credit cards.
  support local forms of payment and emulate local business models
  Cash-on-delivery (COD)

  Mobile money is another banking alternative that’s heavily used in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
  The mobile money transfer app, M-PESA, allows users in Kenya to send and receive money using PIN-secured text messages.

- Bridge the cultural divide
  As researchers and designers, we embody a certain social class, area, or background of privilege—bridging those differences needs to be top-of-mind in order to make our work successful.
  Given that social context, it’s easy to understand these women’s fears about information security,
  demonstrate our trustworthiness in the sign-on portal, "Your number is safe with us" and then link to an FAQ page addressing all of the questions we heard in our research.

  For example, if train stations are considered risky places in Manila, does your app’s map show alternate modes of transport? If men are more likely to own devices, how can you design your app to be more democratic?


  The messaging app Hike allows people to automatically hide certain chats when the application is closed and access them later using a password. In a culture where young people often share devices with family members, this virtual private space is a boon.

- Get beyond language
  Many regions are multi-lingual, with a mix of regional, vernacular, and official languages. India, for example, has 22 languages with over a million speakers each.

  needs of users who’ve never learned to read or write. “Intuitive interfaces” are often called out in design discussions in any context,

  app design will be more intuitive if you minimize text-based inputs and eliminate hierarchies understood only through language.

  Kijai, a woman I met in Jinja, learns how to use apps through symbolic and visual literacy. She relies on visual affordances like icons to identify components and features. This also impacts the way she uses search: Kijai and her daughter search for topics online and then switch to Google images to navigate the results more easily.


  Have you tested your app for local languages and low-literacy users?

  - Leverage human relationships
offline nearby sharing
contacts


- Leave minimalism at the door

The minimal interface just couldn’t compete for the user’s attention in a place where local visuals are more vibrant and dense. Aesthetic styles that are currently popular in the west—such as minimal use of color, sound, and text, as well as abstracted visual elements—can lose impact in a more sensory-rich environment. But people still need to easily navigate your app. The line between density and clutter is a tricky one. Balance meaningfulness and hierarchy with the local aesthetic.

How can your interface speak to the local visual aesthetic?

- Design for delight
