## Elise - The importance of assistive technology
there is value in difference

Difference helps us think creatively and helps us see gaps in our products.

people who experience the world differently, we build better products that are more adaptable, that are longer-lasting, and more innovative.

When we talk about accessibility, we are talking about how to make a product accessible by people with different abilities. But when we talk about inclusive design, what we're doing is we're looking to difference, to their different experiences and their needs, because of their different capabilities. And gathering these insights, and applying it in a way that it will benefit everyone, whether they have a disability or not.

If we go back in terms of how we used to do websites, they used to be very text heavy. They used to be more like a book. And people with disabilities, for years, had been advocating for larger text and less content, much more smaller chunks of text. And when we started to design for accessibility, we created sites that were much more easily consumed.

ask them what their experiences are like with different technology as they go about their world.
Learning these unique experiences is what's going to make you see opportunities for great design in your products.
