### Presentation

Hi All!
I'm Mattia from Turin, Italy, and currently I'm a web developer.
I tried a lot of different IT fields but I found that only Web design and Development have a unique feature: a direct relationship with the user and with the content you want to represent.
I think a website should always be a digital experience. Maybe not everything can be fun, but everything can be presented in an interesting way that stimulates imagination, curiosity and feelings. When I try to design I always try to create frictionless web apps using anticipatory design and inclusivity, but my top priority Is to collaborate with the owner to give the max depth to his content and a reason for users to visit his website. I occasionally collaborate with no-profit orgs because it makes me feel important.  
In a good web site I love: empathetic content, curated typography, clean css and creative layouts.
I love cats, exotic food, gardening, creepy stuff and D&D.


### Intro

goal make technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use

**UX**
How a person feels about interacting with or experiencing a product

UX design is a user-centered approach.

GOOD experience:
- **useable (usability)** easy to use. clear design, structure, purpose.
consider every users uses the product
- **equitable** product for people with different abilities and backgrounds
- **enjoyable**
- **useful** it solves problems

### Jobs

interaction designers
They figure out how to connect the users' needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build.

There are also visual designers who focus on how a product or technology looks.

Motion designers are another common type of UX designer. They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website.

Similar to UX designers, there are also graphic designers who create visuals that tell a story or message.

production designers, who often act as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers. They make sure the first and final designs match in the finished product materials and that the assets are ready to be handed off to the engineering team.

UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish.

## product development life cycle
**brainstorm**

When the team starts thinking of an idea for a product. Your team might already know the user problem that you want to solve when you begin the product development life cycle. If not, coming up with a list of user problems is a great place to start.

After you’ve brainstormed lots of user problems, your team chooses one and starts coming up with ideas for solutions to that problem.

The brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's competitors and identify if there are already similar products available in the market. You want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products.

**define**
the product. The goal is to figure out the specifications for the product by answering questions like: Who is the product for? What will the product do? And, what features need to be included for the product to be successful?
during the define stage, your team narrows the focus of your idea.

**design**
UX designers develop the ideas for the product wireframes

creating prototypes
 include all of the product specifications that were outlined in the define stage.

 **test**

-alpha testing, tests the product internally to look for technical glitches and usability problems.  
-test with stakeholders, product is aligned with the company’s vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy...
-External test with potential users.

development life cycle isn’t a completely linear process


### Design for a good user experience

create account -> have an idea of what to do next
press a button -> what you thought will happen happens


icons are easier to look up and understand
but sometimes meanings are hard you need text

or the user to have a good experience, the product needs to be useable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful among other things.

each product shoud make feel user in a way

What exactly makes a product effective to its users? Is it a matter of simplicity, structure, or functionality? The answer depends on the product in question.

Product leads: Product leads are in charge of ensuring the final product’s success and communicating with stakeholders. Your product lead will define the project’s core goals and deliverables, so you can focus on creating innovative design solutions. At some companies, product leads are known as product managers.

Program managers: Program managers ensure clear and timely communication across the team, so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. Program managers supervise, support, and keep track of the project as a whole. They assign tasks to team members, monitor the project budget, and manage timelines, among other things. Think of your team’s program manager as your go-to source of support when facing any setbacks or issues with your work.
